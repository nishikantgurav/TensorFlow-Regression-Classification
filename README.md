# TensorFlow-Regression-Classification
This project goes through how our neural network predicts for Regression problem and how it predicts for the classification problem. 
For the regression problem I used "House Sales in King County, USA" dataset.This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
It's a great dataset for evaluating simple regression models.

For Classificaion problem I used "Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic)" dataset.This is a copy of UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets.
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
